# FPL-best-11-select
Trying to be better at SQL using this FPL dataset from kaggle for selecting the best 11.
--This code was built using Microsoft  SQL Server Management Studio.The journey is going to be from having the results in excel and using a visualization tool to visualise results.
The journey of every data analyst right?

Dataset for the analysis can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/rajatrc1705/english-premier-league202021

Feel free to give any suggestions as you go through the code. I am just a beginner so go easy.lol.
